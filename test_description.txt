 Title
React Weather Forecast App
 Description
Build a weather app that shows a 24-hour forecast using data from a local mock server. Include real-
time data retrieval, pull-to-refresh, error handling, and offline support. Add unit tests and clear
commits.
 Project Steps:
- Start the Local Mock Server: Use the Mockoon tool to launch the local mock server.
- Fetch Weather Data: Retrieve weather data from the local mock server.
- Display Data in a List: The list should include the following details:
• Wind speed
• Temperature
• Apparent temperature
• ⚠ Important: Use the "timestep": "1h" field to fetch weather data for each
upcoming hour.
- Add a pull-to-refresh functionality.
- Handle potential errors gracefully.
- Write Unit Tests: Ensure core functionalities are tested with Jest.
- Offline Data Support : The app must display previously fetched data even when offline.
 Guidelines
- You must at least complete step 4.
- Your commits should be clear and reflect your thought process.
- The expected technologies are Jest, Axios, and a state management tool (Redux, Mobx, or
equivalent).
- The application's design (UI) is up to you.
